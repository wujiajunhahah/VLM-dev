## Features

- FastVLM runs on iOS (18.2+) and macOS (15.2+).
- View Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with every inference.
- All predictions are processed privately and securely using on-device models.

### Flexible Prompting

The app includes a set of built-in prompts to help you get started quickly. Tap the **Prompts** button in the top-right corner to explore them. Selecting a prompt will immediately update the active input. To create new prompts or edit existing ones, choose **Customizeâ€¦** from the **Prompts** menu.

## Pretrained Model Options

There are 3 pretrained sizes of FastVLM to choose from:

- **FastVLM 0.5B**: Small and fast - great for mobile devices where speed matters.
- **FastVLM 1.5B**: Well balanced - great for larger devices where speed and accuracy matters.
- **FastVLM 7B**: Fast and accurate - ideal for situations where accuracy matters over speed.

To download any FastVLM listed above, use the [get_pretrained_mlx_model.sh](get_pretrained_mlx_model.sh) script. The script downloads the model from the web and places it in the appropriate location. Once a model has been downloaded using the steps below, no additional steps are needed to build the app in Xcode.

To explore how the other models work for your use-case, simply re-run the `get_pretrained_mlx_model.sh` with the new model selected, follow the prompts, and rebuild your app in Xcode.

### Download Instructions

1. Make the script executable

```shell
chmod +x app/get_pretrained_mlx_model.sh
```

2. Download FastVLM

```shell
app/get_pretrained_mlx_model.sh --model 0.5b --dest app/FastVLM/model
```

3. Open the app in Xcode, Build, and Run.

### Custom Model

In addition to pretrained sizes of FastVLM, you can further quantize or fine-tune FastVLM to best fit their needs. To learn more, check out our documentation on how to [`export the model`](../model_export#export-vlm).
Please clear existing model in `app/FastVLM/model` before downloading or copying a new model.
